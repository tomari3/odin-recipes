    <p> A twice-baked potato is the perfect love child of a baked potato and mashed potatoes. It’s also a brilliant
        blank canvas for so many flavors.
    </p>
    <p>
        A classic version is made with cheese, sour cream and bacon, but this vegetarian recipe sneaks in spinach for
        some extra veg, Greek yogurt for a boost of protein and creamy, salty feta for
        can’t-stop-eating flavor. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

    <li>4 large Russet Potatoes (about 320 grams each), scrubbedand dried</li>
    <li>1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups Greek yogurt</li>
    <li>2 (10-ounce) boxes frozen spinach, thawed and very welldrained</li>
    <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons finely minced fresh dill</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely minced fresh parsley</li>
    <li>8 ounces feta, divided</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h2> Preheat the oven: </h2>
        <li> Heat oven to 400°F. </li>
        <h2> Bake the potatoes: </h2>
        <li> Prick the potatoes all over with the tines of a fork or tip of a paring knife. Rub
            them with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            
            Place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake until they’re tender throughout (they should slip off a cake tester or paring knife when poked), 60 to 70 minutes.
            
             Let them rest for 10 to 15 minutes, until they’re cool enough to handle. </li>
        <h2> Split and Scoop the potatoes: </h2>
        <li>Split the potatoes lengthwise and create a potato shell by scooping out the center, leaving a 1/4-inch rim. Put the scooped out flesh into a large bowl and give it a rough mash with a potato masher or large fork. </li>
        <h2> Finish making the filling: </h2>
        <li> To the bowl with potato flesh, add the yogurt, spinach, scallion, dill, parsley and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and 1 teaspoon salt.

            Crumble in 6 ounces of feta and mash and mix well, until the filling is uniform and creamy. Taste filling and add black pepper to taste. </li>
        <h2> Stuff the potato shells: </h2>
        <li>Divide the filling among the shells and pat into shape as needed. Finely crumble the remaining 2 ounces of feta evenly over the potatoes. </li>
        <h2> Bake again: </h2>
        <li>Bake the stuffed potatoes until the filling is heated through and cheese has browned, 15 to 18 minutes. </li>
        <h2>Serve</h2>
        <li>Twice baked potatoes are best served immediately on their own, with a salad or alongside a protein of your choice. </li>
    </ol>
