    <h2>So what is it about Philly Cheesesteak Casserole</h2>
        <p>Philly Cheesesteak Casserole is a warm dish inspired by the classic Philly Cheesesteak, a sliced steak and onion sandwich served on a roll and topped with cheese. It’s a rich and meaty casserole that is comfort food at its best. </p>
        <p>The casserole has ground beef, onions, peppers, and mushrooms. It’s tossed with cream cheese and provolone, topped with crispy croutons, and baked until the filling is piping hot and melty.  </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

    <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef, 90/10 blend</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, stemmed and chopped</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
    <li>8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and chopped</li>
    <li>8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
    <li>6 ounces sliced provolone cheese, divided</li>
    <li>1 hoagie roll, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h3> Preheat the oven:  </h3>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Grease the bottom of an 8 x 8-inch casserole dish with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. </li>
        <h3> Cook the beef:  </h3>
        <li> In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. 

            Cook the beef until browned, 5 to 6 minutes, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked beef into a large bowl and set it aside. Don’t wipe out the skillet.  </li>
        <h3> Cook the veggies: </h3>
        <li>
            In the same skillet set over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Sauté for 8 to 10 minutes until the vegetables release most of their liquid and evenly brown.</li>
        <h3> Make the filling:  </h3>
        <li> Add the cooked veggies and the cream cheese to the bowl of beef. 

            Take half of the provolone cheese slices, stack them on top of each other on a cutting board and use a chef’s knife to cut it into small pieces. Add it to the bowl with the veggies and the beef. Stir well until combined. Transfer the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. 
            
            Lay the remaining sliced provolone cheese in an even layer on top.  </li>
        <h3> Make the croutons:  </h3>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss the cubed bread with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Evenly sprinkle it over the casserole.</li>
        <h3> Bake the casserole:  </h3>
        <li>Bake the casserole for 25 to 30 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and the croutons are browned on top. Remove it from oven and let it cool briefly on your counter. Serve it warm.</li>
